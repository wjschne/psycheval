\title{Conditional Covariance}
\usage{
conditional_covariance(x, sigma, mu = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{named numeric vector of predictor scores}

\item{sigma}{named covariance matrix of predictor and outcome variables}

\item{mu}{a single numeric mean for all variables or a named vector of means of predictor and outcome variables}
}
\value{
list of conditional means and a covariance matrix
\itemize{
\item \code{mu_conditional} - The means of the outcome variables conditioned on the values of the predictors in vector x.
\item \code{mu_sigma} - The covariance matrix of the outcome variables conditioned on the values of the predictors in vector x.
\item \code{descriptives_conditional} - A data frame of means and standard deviations of the outcome variables conditioned on the values of the predictors in vector x.
\item \code{x} - The predictor scores from the x parameter
\item \code{sigma} - The unconditional covariance matrix from the sigma parameter
\item \code{mu} - Anamed vector of unconditional means
\item \code{beta} - Regression Coefficients for finding mu_conditional
}

\examples{
# Named vector of predictor scores
x <- c(A = 1)

# Named vector of unconditional means
mu <- c(A = 0, B = 0, C = 0)

# Unconditional covariance matrix with row and column names
sigma <- matrix(c(1, .5, .5,
                  .5, 1, .5,

                                names(mu)))

# Conditoinal means and covariance matrix
